  Implement a C program to demonstrate call by value and call by reference by swapping two integers using separate functions.
# Date : 
# Aim:
 To implement a C program that illustrates the difference between call by value and call by reference by swapping two integer variables using two separate functions.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  Declare two functions:
  - `swapv(int, int)` for swapping using call by value  
  - `swapr(int *, int *)` for swapping using call by reference
### Step 4: 
  In the `main()` function, declare two integer variables `a` and `b` and initialize them with values (e.g., 10 and 20).
### Step 5: 
  Print the values of `a` and `b` before calling `swapv()`.
### Step 6: 
  Call the function `swapv(a, b)` and print the values of `a` and `b` after the function call to show that call by value does not change the original values.
### Step 7: 
  Print the values of `a` and `b` before calling `swapr()`.
### Step 8: 
  Call the function `swapr(&a, &b)` using the addresses of `a` and `b`.
### Step 9: 
  Print the values of `a` and `b` after the `swapr()` function call to show that call by reference successfully swaps the original values.
### Step 10: 
  Inside `swapv(x, y)` function:
  - **Step 10.1:** Swap the values of `x` and `y` using a temporary variable.  
  - **Step 10.2:** Print the swapped values (formal parameters).
### Step 11: 
  Inside `swapr(*x, *y)` function:
  - **Step 11.1:** Swap the values pointed to by `x` and `y`.  
  - **Step 11.2:** Print the swapped values (affects actual parameters).
### Step 12: 
  Stop

### Step 8:
  Use a `for` loop from `i = 0` to `i < n` to:  
  - **Step 8.1:** Call the recursive function `fibo(i)`  
  - **Step 8.2:** Print the returned Fibonacci value  
### Step 9:
 Define the recursive function `fibo(x)` as follows:  
 - **Step 9.1:** If `x == 0` or `x == 1`, return `x`.  
 - **Step 9.2:** Otherwise, return `fibo(x - 1) + fibo(x - 2)`.

   Implement a C program to demonstrate recursion by printing a sequence of even or odd numbers from a given lower limit to an upper limit, with each recursive call progressing by 2.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To implement a C program that uses a recursive function to print even or odd numbers in a specified range based on the starting value provided by the user.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>. 
### Step 3:
  Declare a recursive function `printEvenOdd(int cur, int limit)` to print numbers from `cur` to `limit` with a step of 2.
### Step 4:
  In the `main()` function, declare two integer variables: `lowerLimit` and `upperLimit`.
### Step 5:
  Prompt the user to enter the lower limit of the range.
### Step 6:
  Read and store the lower limit.
### Step 7:
  Prompt the user to enter the upper limit of the range.
### Step 8:
  Read and store the upper limit.
### Step 9:
  Display a message indicating that the even/odd numbers in the given range will be printed.
### Step 10:
  Call the recursive function `printEvenOdd(lowerLimit, upperLimit)`.
### Step 11:
  Inside the function `printEvenOdd(cur, limit)`:
  - **Step 11.1:** If `cur > limit`, terminate the recursion.  
  - **Step 11.2:** If `cur == limit`, print the value without a trailing comma.  
  - **Step 11.3:** Otherwise, print the current value followed by a comma.  
  - **Step 11.4:** Recursively call `printEvenOdd(cur + 2, limit)` to print the next number.

   Implement a C program that dynamically allocates memory using calloc(), accepts integer inputs from the user, computes their sum, and prints the sum.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To implement a C program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers using calloc(), accepts elements from the user, computes their sum, and displays the sum.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>. 
### Step 3:
  a. Declare a pointer `ptr` to `int`.  
  b. Declare integers `n`, `i`, and `sum` (initialize `sum = 0`).
### Step 4:
  Read the integer `n` from the user (the number of integers to be stored).
### Step 5:
  Use the `calloc()` function to allocate memory for `n` integers:  
  `ptr = calloc(n, sizeof(int))`
### Step 6:
  If `ptr` is not `NULL`, continue to the next step; otherwise, memory allocation failed (the program exits).
### Step 7:
  For each `i` from `0` to `n - 1`:  
  a. Read an integer from the user.  
  b. Store it at memory location `ptr + i`.
### Step 8:
  For each `i` from `0` to `n - 1`:  
  a. Access the value stored at `ptr + i`.  
  b. Add it to `sum`.
### Step 9:
  Print the value of `sum`.
### Step 10:
  Call `free(ptr);` to release the memory allocated by `calloc()`.
